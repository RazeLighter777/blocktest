#include "name_component.h"

// This file contains the implementation for NameComponent.
// Currently, NameComponent is a simple struct with just a string,
// so no additional implementation is needed beyond what's in the header.
// This file exists to maintain consistency with the project structure
// and to allow for future expansion of the component functionality.
